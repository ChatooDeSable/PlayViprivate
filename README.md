# PlayVi

[__Try PlayVi !__](https://dbilgili.github.io/playvi/) üéâ

__PlayVi__ is a simple web application built on top of Spotify API in order to simplify the process of creating a public playlist and collaborating on it with minimum hassle.


Anyone including those who doesn't have a Spotify account can contribute to a playlist created through __PlayVi__. However, a Spotify account is required to play the playlist eventually.

It is built to look and work better on mobile devices, but you can use it with a browser virtually on any device.

## __Starting a Party__

Once you start a party, a public Spotify playlist is automatically generated for you along with a four-digit pin code to share with your friends, those who are going to contribute to the playlist.

_When you create a party, you become the party admin and you have the privilige of being able to remove any song from the playlist, because it's your party and why you would let someone ruin it with cheesy songs._ üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the example screen below, a Spotify playlist named `cyanDaisy` is created along with the party pin of `6971`.

As an alternative, you can use the query string of `?pin=` with your party pin to make it even easier joining to a party.

## __Joining to a party__

Hit `Join to a party` button and then use the party pin along with a nickname you desire and then you have access to the party as a contributer.

_You can add songs and only remove the songs you have added._

## __Basic usage__

- Create a party.
- Share the party pin with people.
- Wait for people to add songs.
- Click the playlist name to open & play it in Spotify.

> Note: Shuffling the playlist makes the flow more natural since people are likely to add songs successively.

When you search for a song under the `Add Songs` tab, you get the top 20 results.

The green circle icon on the right top corner of the album cover indicates that the song has a preview.

You can tap/click the album cover and listen to it. Tapping/clicking the song name adds it to the playlist.

_If a song is already in the playlist, it gets greyed out and cannot be added again._

Link to playlist and party pin can always be accessed through more options icon [...]
